# React tic-tac-toe

This project is a game featured on React tutorial "Intro to React" (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I completed the tutorial and added some other features proposed at the end of the tutorial.

### The main features are:

- It indicates when a user won the game.
- The game's history is saved so you can go back to previous turns.

### Features I added:

- Location of every move (col/row format) is displayed in the move history list.
